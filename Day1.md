<h2>The History of Markup</h2>
What is a Markup Language: A markup language is a system for annotating a document in a way that is distinguishable from the actual content of the document. It uses predefined set of symbols or tags to define formats \

**Types of Markup Langages**:
Presentatiion Markup(HTML{Hyperext Markup Language}): focuses on how the document is displayed or formatted

    Descriptive Markup(XML {extensible Markup Language }): Focuses on the meaning and structure rather than its appearance

    Procedural Markup: Specifies instruction for softwre to process a document eg LaTex , used for typesetting complex documents

_Sample example:_
HTML => <h1>This is a HTML Format</h1>
XML => <person>
<name>Abdullahi Muhammad Jamil</name>
<age>30</age>
</person>

    if name ==="Saadatu"{
        alert("Hello Dev-Saa🤗)
    }
